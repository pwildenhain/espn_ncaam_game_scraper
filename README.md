Scrapes play by play data and roster data from individual games and processes the data

The goal of this project is to facilitate the creation of data sets and visual outputs from a single NCAA men's basketball game. Most online data sources do not let you segment by time within a game or even analyze statistical changes between periods. However, this project will eventually allow you to pull and visualize most basic statistics for a team or individual player by either period (first half, second half, overtime) or from a discrete period of time.
